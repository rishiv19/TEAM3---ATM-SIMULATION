Sure, Hari! Here's a complete `README.md` tailored for running your `ATMSystem.jar` Java application when the manifest doesn’t include a `Main-Class`.

```markdown
# 🏦 ATM System - Java Application

This project simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It's packaged as a JAR file and run manually by specifying the main class because the JAR does not include a `Main-Class` entry in its manifest.

---

## 📁 File Structure

```plaintext
ATMSystem.jar
└── com/
    └── example/
        └── ATMSystemMain.class
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### ✨ Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- `ATMSystem.jar` located in your system (e.g., `Downloads` folder).

### 🔧 Instructions

1. Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the JAR file:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\harih\Downloads
   ```

3. Run the application by specifying the full class name manually:
   ```bash
   java -cp ATMSystem.jar com.example.ATMSystemMain
   ```

> 🔁 Replace `com.example.ATMSystemMain` with your actual fully qualified class name that contains `public static void main(String[] args)`.

## 🔍 Finding the Main Class

If you're unsure which class contains the `main()` method:

```bash
jar tf ATMSystem.jar
```

Scan the listed `.class` files and look for a candidate like `ATMSystemMain.class`.

## 💡 Optional: Make JAR Executable

To avoid specifying the class name every time, you can rebuild the JAR with a manifest:

1. Create a file named `manifest.txt`:
   ```
   Main-Class: com.example.ATMSystemMain
   ```

2. Repackage your JAR:
   ```bash
   jar cfm ATMSystem.jar manifest.txt -C path/to/classes .
   ```

Now you can run the JAR directly:
```bash
java -jar ATMSystem.jar
```
